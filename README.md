# Modern C++ for Computational Scientists

Since the 2011 revision to the C++ language and standard library, the
ways it is now being used are quite different. Used well, these
features enable the programmer to write elegant, reusable and portable
code that runs efficiently on a variety of architectures.

However it is still a very large and complex tool. This set of
lectures and practical exercises, will cover a minimal set of features
to allow an experienced non-C++ programmer to get to grips with
language.

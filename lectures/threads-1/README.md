# C++11 threads

- API for multithreaded programming built in to C++11 standard
- Similar functionality to POSIX threads
  - but with a proper OO interface
  - based quite heavily on Boost threads library
- Portable
  - depends on C++11 support, available in most compilers today
- Threads are C++ objects
  - call a constructor to create a thread
- Synchronisation
  - mutex locks
  - condition variables
  - C++11 atomics
- Tasks
  - via async/futures/promises 

---
# Creating threads

- Threads are objects of the `std::thread` class
- Threads are created by calling the constructor for this class
- Pass as an argument what we want the thread to execute. This can be:
  - A function pointer
  - A function object / functor
  - A lambda expression

- Note: you cannot copy a thread
  
---
# Joining threads

The `join()` member function on a `std::thread` object causes the calling thread to wait for the thread object to finish executing its function/functor/lambda.

---
# Hello world – function pointer

```C++
#include <thread>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

void hello() {
  std::cout << "Hello from thread " << std::this_thread::get_id() << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  std::vector<std::thread> threads;
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
    threads.push_back(std::thread(hello));
  }

  for (auto& thread: threads) {
    thread.join();
  }
}
```

---
# Hello world – lambda function

```C++
#include <thread>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  std::vector<std::thread> threads;

  for(int i = 0; i < 5; ++i){
    threads.push_back(std::thread([] {
      std::cout << "Hello from thread " << std::this_thread::get_id() << std::endl;
    }));
  }

  for(auto& thread : threads){
    thread.join();
  }
}
```

---
# Thread IDs

- Can call `get_id()`on a thread
- Use `std::this_thread::get_id()` to call it on the executing thread
- Returns an arbitrary identifier
- Not much use! 
- If we want sequentially numbered threads, need to pass the number as an argument to the thread constructor.

---
# Passing arguments to threads

Arguments to the thread function are moved or copied by value

Passing simple arguments to threads is straightforward: 
```C++
void hello(int x, int y) {
  std::cout << "Hello " << x << " " << y << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  int a = 1;
  int b = 27;
  std::thread mythread(hello, a, b);
  mythread.join();
}
```

---
# Passing references to threads

Need to use a reference wrapper to avoid the argument to the thread constructor making a copy 
```C++
void hello(int& x) {
  x++;
}

int main() {
  int x = 9;
  std::thread mythread(hello, std::ref(x));
  mythread.join();
  std::cout << "x = " << x << std::endl; // x is 10 here
}
```

---
# Synchronisation

```C++
class Wallet
{
  int mMoney = 0;
public:
  Wallet() {}

  void addMoney(int money) {
    mMoney += money;
  }
};
```

If two threads call `addMoney()` on the same `Wallet` object, then we have a race condition.

---
# Mutex locks

- Can use a mutex lock to protect updates to shared variables
  - natural to declare a mutex inside the object whose data needs protecting

```C++
#include <mutex>
class Wallet
{
  int mMoney = 0;
  std::mutex mutex;
public:
  Wallet() {}

  void addMoney(int money) {
    mutex.lock();
    mMoney += money;
    mutex.unlock();
  }
};
```

---
# Guard objects

- Need to make sure a mutex is always unlocked
- Can be tricky in cases with complex control flow, or with exception handling. 
- The `std::lock_guard` class implements the RAII (resource allocation is initialization) pattern for mutexes
- Its constructor takes as an argument a mutex, which it then locks
- Its destructor unlocks the mutex 

---
# Guard objects

```C++
#include <mutex> 

class Wallet
{
  int mMoney = 0;
  std::mutex mutex;
public:
  Wallet() {}

  void addMoney(int money) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lockGuard(mutex);
    mMoney += money;
  } // mutex unlocked when lockGuard goes out of scope
};
```

---
# Atomics

- C++ provides an atomic template class `std::atomic`

- Efficient, lock-free operations supported for specialization to basic integer, boolean and character types

- Floating point support in C++20 standard only

---
# Atomics

```C++
#include <atomic>

class Wallet
{
  std::atomic<int> mMoney = 0;
public:
  Wallet() {}
  void addMoney(int money) {
    mMoney += money; //atomic increment
  }
  };
```

---
# Thread safe class design

- Possible to add a mutex data member to the class and make every member function that accesses any mutable state acquire and release the mutex (use a `lock_guard`)

- Good design, in the sense that multithreaded code can use the class without worrying about the synchronisation

- Can result in unacceptable overheads – lots of lock/unlocks, and synchronization when it’s not needed. 

- Need to think carefully about use cases in a given application.
